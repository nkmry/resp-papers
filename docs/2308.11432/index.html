<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research topic in the academic community.
Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from the human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions.
Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence.
This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating autonomous agents based on LLMs. To harness the full potential of LLMs, researchers have devised diverse agent architectures tailored to different applications.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of autonomous agents from a holistic perspective.
More specifically, our focus lies in the construction of LLM-based agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Additionally, we provide a summary of the various applications of LLM-based AI agents in the domains of social science, natural science, and engineering. Lastly, we discuss the commonly employed evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI agents.
Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.
To keep track of this field and continuously update our survey, we maintain a repository for the related references at https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Autonomous agents have long been seen as a promising path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), capable of accomplishing tasks through self-directed planning and instructions.
In earlier paradigms, the policy functions that dictated the agent’s actions were conceived through heuristic methodologies and subsequently refined through environmental engagements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib101" title="" class="ltx_ref">101</a>, <a href="#bib.bib86" title="" class="ltx_ref">86</a>, <a href="#bib.bib120" title="" class="ltx_ref">120</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>]</cite>. A discernible gap has emerged wherein these functions often fall short of replicating human-level proficiency, particularly in unconstrained, open-domain settings. Such discrepancies can be traced back to potential inaccuracies inherent in the heuristic designs and the circumscribed knowledge furnished by the training environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, indicating their potential for achieving human-like intelligence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="" class="ltx_ref">116</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib130" title="" class="ltx_ref">130</a>, <a href="#bib.bib131" title="" class="ltx_ref">131</a>]</cite>.
This capability emerges from the utilization of comprehensive training datasets coupled with a substantial array of model parameters.
Motivated by this capability, a burgeoning trend has emerged in recent years (see Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> for the growth trend of this field), wherein LLMs are harnessed as core orchestrators in the creation of autonomous agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>, <a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>, <a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>, <a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>, <a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite>. This strategic employment aims to emulate human-like decision-making processes, thereby providing a pathway towards more sophisticated and adaptive artificial intelligence systems. Along the direction of LLM-based autonomous agents, people have designed many promising models, focusing on enhancing LLMs with essential capabilities, such as memory and planning, enabling them to stimulate human actions and proficiently undertake a range of tasks. However, these models are proposed independently, and there have been limited efforts in summarizing and comparing them holistically. It is crucial to construct a holistic summarization analysis for existing LLM-based autonomous agents works, which holds great significance in developing a comprehensive understanding of this field and serving as inspiration for future research.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents.
Specifically, we organize our survey based on three aspects including the construction, application, and evaluation of LLM-based autonomous agents.
For the agent construction, we present a unified framework composed of four components, that is, a profile module to represent agent attributes, a memory module to store historical information, a planning module to strategize future actions, and an action module to execute the planned decisions.
By disabling one or more modules, the majority of previous studies can be viewed as specific examples of this framework.
After introducing the typical agent modules, we also provide a summary of the commonly-used fine-tuning strategies to enhance the adaptability of the agent for different application scenarios.
In addition to constructing the agent, we provide an overview of the potential applications of autonomous agents, exploring how these agents can enhance the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering.
Finally, we discuss the methods for evaluating autonomous agents, focusing on both subjective and objective strategies.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">LLM-based autonomous agents are expected to effectively accomplish different tasks based on the human-like capabilities of LLMs.
In order to achieve this goal, there are two significant aspects, that is, (1) which architecture should be designed to better use LLMs and (2) how to learn the parameters of the architecture.
Within the context of architectural design, we contribute a systematic synthesis of existing research, culminating in a comprehensive unified framework.
As for the second aspect, we summarize three commonly employed strategies including (1) learning from examples, where the model is fine-tuned based on curated datasets, (2) learning from environment feedback, leveraging real-time interactions and observations, and (3) learning from human feedback, capitalizing on human expertise and intervention for refinement.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Recent advancements in Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to accomplish a wide range of tasks.
However, only based on LLMs, it is hard to effectively realize an autonomous agent due to their architecture limitations.
To bridge this gap, previous work has developed a number of modules to inspire and enhance the capabilities of LLMs for building autonomous agents.
In this section, we propose a unified framework to summarize the architectures proposed in the previous work<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">*</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">*</span>Our framework is also inspired by a pioneer work at https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/</span></span></span>.
In specific, the overall structure of our framework is illustrated Figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2.1.1 Profiling Module ‣ 2.1 Agent Architecture Design ‣ 2 LLM-based Autonomous Agent Construction ‣ A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, which is composed of a profiling module, a memory module, a planning module, and an action module.
The purpose of the profiling module is to identify the role of the agent.
The memory and planning modules place the agent into a dynamic environment, enabling it to recall past behaviors and plan future actions.
The action module is responsible for translating the agent’s decisions into specific outputs.
Within these modules, the profiling module impacts the memory and planning modules, and collectively, these three modules influence the action module.
In the following, we detail these modules.</p>
</div>
<section id="S2.SS1.SSS1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">2.1.1 </span>Profiling Module</h4>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">autonomous agents typically perform tasks by assuming specific roles, such as coders, teachers and domain experts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>.
The profiling module aims to indicate the role profiles of the agents, which are usually written into the prompt to influence the LLM behaviors.
In existing work, there are three commonly used strategies for generating agent profiles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Handcrafting Method</span>:
in this method, the profiles of agents are manually specified. For instance, if one would like to design agents with different personalities, he can use "you are an outgoing person" or "you are an introverted person" to profile the agent.
The handcrafting method has been leveraged in a lot of previous work to indicate the agent profiles.
In specific, Generative Agent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite> describes the agent by the information like name, objectives, and relationships with other agents.
MetaGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>, ChatDev <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>, and Self-collaboration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> predefine various roles and their corresponding responsibilities in software development, manually assigning distinct profiles to each agent to facilitate collaboration.
A recent work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> demonstrates that manually assigning different personas significantly impacts LLM’s generation, including toxicity. By assigning specific personas, they show increased toxicity versus default personas.
In general, the handcrafting method is very flexible. However, it can be labor-intensive, particularly when dealing with a large number of agents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LLM-generation Method</span>:
in this method, the agent profiles are automatically generated based on LLMs.
Typically, it begins by providing manual prompts that outline specific generation rules and elucidates the composition and attributes of the agent profiles within the target population. In addition, it may specify initial seed agent profiles to serve as few-shot examples. These profiles then serve as the foundation for generating other agent information based on LLMs.
For example, RecAgent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib134" title="" class="ltx_ref">134</a>]</cite> first creates seed profiles for a small number of agents by manually crafting details like age, gender, personal traits, and movie preferences. Then, it leverages ChatGPT to generate more agent profiles based on the seed information.
The LLM-generation method can save significant time when the number of agents is large, but it may lack precise control over the generated profiles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Dataset Alignment Method</span>:
in this method, the agent profiles are indicated based on real-world datasets.
The basic information of real humans is fully or selectively leveraged to describe the agents.
For example, the agents in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> are initialized based on the participant demographic backgrounds in real-world survey datasets.
The dataset alignment method can accurately capture the attributes of the real population, effectively bridging the gap between the virtual and real worlds.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the profile generation strategies, another important problem is how to specify the information for profiling the agents.
Examples of information include demographic information, which introduces the characteristics of a population (e.g., age, gender, and income), psychology information, which indicates the personalities of the agents, and social information, which describes the relationships between agents.
The choice of information to profile the agent is largely determined by the specific application scenarios.
For instance, if the study focuses on user social behaviors, social profile information becomes pivotal.
However, establishing the relationship between the profile information and downstream tasks is not always straightforward.
A potential solution would be to input all possible profile information initially and then develop automatic methods (<em id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, based on LLMs) to select the most suitable one.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The memory module plays a very important role in the construction of AI agents.
It stores information perceived from the environment and leverages the recorded memories to facilitate future actions.
The memory module can help the agent to accumulate experiences, self-evolve, and behave in a more consistent, reasonable, and effective manner.
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the memory module, focusing on its structures, formats, and operations.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Memory Structures</span>: LLM-based autonomous agents usually incorporate principles and mechanisms derived from cognitive science research on human memory processes. Human memory follows a general progression from sensory memory that registers perceptual inputs, to short-term memory that maintains information transiently, to long-term memory that consolidates information over extended periods. When designing memory architectures for AI agents, researchers take inspiration from these aspects of human memory while also recognizing key differences in capabilities.
Short-term memory in AI agents is analogous to learning capacities supported within the context window constraints of the Transformer architecture. Long-term memory resembles the external vector storage that agents can rapidly query and retrieve from as needed. Thus, while humans gradually transfer perceived information from short-term to long-term stores via reinforcement, AI agents can engineer more optimized writing and reading processes between their algorithmically implemented memory systems. By emulating aspects of human memory, designers can create agents that leverage memory processes for improved reasoning and autonomy. In the following, we introduce two types of commonly used memory structures.</p>

In this structure, the memories are organized into a single framework, and there are no distinctions between the short- and long-term memories. The framework has unified interfaces for memory reading, writing, and reflection.
For example,
Atlas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">65</a>]</cite> stores document memories based on universal dense vectors, which are generated from a dual-encoder model.
Augmented LLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite> employs a unified external storage for its memory, which can be accessed via prompts.
Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> also utilizes a unified memory architecture, where skills of different complexities are gathered in a central library.
During code generation, skills can be indexed based on their relevance for matching and retrieval.
ChatLog <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib132" title="" class="ltx_ref">132</a>]</cite> maintains a unified memory stream, which allows the model to retain important historical information and adaptively adjust the agents themselves for different environments.</p>

Hybrid memory clearly differentiates between short-term and long-term functions. The short-term component temporarily buffers recent perceptions, while long-term memory consolidates important information over time.
For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite> employs a dual-layered memory structure to store an agent’s experiences and knowledge, comprising a long-term memory and a short-term memory. Long-term memory is utilized to preserve the agent’s understanding and summarization of the entire world, while short-term memory is employed to retain the agent’s comprehension and annotations of individual events.
AgentSims <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>]</cite> also implements a hybrid memory architecture. The long-term memory utilizes a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve the episodic memories of each agent. LLMs are employed to realize the short-term memory and perform abstraction, validation, correction, and simulation tasks.
In GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite>, the short-term memory stores the current trajectory, and the long-term memory saves reference plans summarized from successful prior trajectories.
Long-term memory provides stable knowledge, while short-term memory allows flexible planning.
Reflexion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> utilizes a short-term sliding window to capture recent feedback and incorporates persistent long-term storage to retain condensed insights. This combination allows for the utilization of both detailed immediate experiences and high-level abstractions.
SCM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib84" title="" class="ltx_ref">84</a>]</cite> selectively activates the most relevant long-term knowledge to combine with short-term memory, enabling reasoning over complex contextual dialogues. SWIFTSAGE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib87" title="" class="ltx_ref">87</a>]</cite> employs a small LM to manage short-term memory for generating intuition and associative thinking, while utilizing a LLM for handling long-term memory to generate well-considered decisions.</p>

Information can be stored in memory using various formats, each offering unique advantages.
For example, natural languages can retain comprehensive semantic information, while embeddings can enhance the efficiency of memory reading. In the following, we present four types of commonly used memory formats.</p>

Using natural languages for task reasoning/programming enables flexible, semantic-rich storage/access. For instance, Reflexion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> stores experiential feedback in natural language within a sliding window.
Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> employs natural language descriptions to represent skills within the Minecraft game, which are directly stored in memory.</p>

Using embeddings to store information can enhance memory retrieval and reading efficiency.
For example, MemoryBank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">158</a>]</cite> encodes each memory segment into an embedding vector, building an indexed corpus for retrieval.
GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> represents reference plans as embeddings to facilitate matching and reuse. ChatDev <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite> encodes dialogue history into vectors for retrieval.</p>

External databases provide structured storage, and one can manipulate the memories with efficient and comprehensive operations.
For example, ChatDB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> utilizes a database as symbolic long-term memory. SQL statements generated by the LLM controller can accurately operate on the database.</p>

Another type of memory format is the structured list, based on which the information can be delivered in a more concise and efficient manner.
For example, GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> stores action lists for sub-goals in a hierarchical tree structure.
The hierarchical structure explicitly captures the relationships between goals and corresponding plans.
RET-LLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite> initially converts natural language sentences into triplet phrases, and subsequently stores them in memory.</p>

The key to memory reading lies in extracting information from the memory.
Usually, there three commonly used criteria for information extraction, that is, the recency, relevance, and importance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>.
Memories that are more recent, relevant, and important are more likely to be extracted.
Formally, we conclude the following equation to extract information:</p>

Agents can acquire knowledge and experiences by storing significant information in their memories.
During the writing process, there are two potential problems that should be carefully addressed.
On one hand, it is crucial to address how to store information that is similar to existing memories (<em id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p13.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, memory duplicated).
On the other hand, it is important to consider how to remove information when the memory reaches its storage limit (<em id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p13.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, memory overflow).
These problems can be resolved based on the following strategies.
(1) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p13.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Memory Duplicated</span>.
To incorporate similar information, people have developed various methods for integrating new and previous records.
For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib108" title="" class="ltx_ref">108</a>]</cite>, the successful action sequences related to the same sub-goal are stored in a list.
Once the size of the list reaches N(=5), all the sequences in it are condensed into a unified plan solution using LLMs.
The original sequences in the memory are replaced with the newly generated one.
Augmented LLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib121" title="" class="ltx_ref">121</a>]</cite> aggregates duplicate information via count accumulation, avoiding redundant storage.
Reflexion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> consolidates related feedback into high-level insights, replacing raw experiences.
(2) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p13.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Memory Overflow</span>.
In order to write information into the memory when it is full, people design different methods to delete existing information to continue the memorizing process.
For example, in ChatDB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>, memories can be explicitly deleted based on the user’s command.
RET-LLM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib102" title="" class="ltx_ref">102</a>]</cite> uses a fixed-size cyclic buffer for memory, overwriting the oldest entries based on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheme.</p>

This operation seeks to empower agents with the ability to condense and deduce more advanced information, or verify and correct their own actions autonomously.
It assists agents in comprehending their own and others’ attributes, preferences, objectives, and connections, which in turn directs their behaviors.
Previous studies have studied various forms of memory reflection, that is, (1) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p14.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Self-summarization</span>.
Reflection can be utilized to condense the agent’s memories into higher-level concepts.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>, the agent has the capability to summarize its past experiences stored in memory into broader and more abstract insights.
Specifically, the agent first generates three key questions based on its recent memories.
Then, these questions are used to query the memory to obtain relevant information.
Building upon the acquired information, the agent generates five insights, which reflect the agent high-level ideas.
Additionally, reflection can occur hierarchically, meaning that insights can be generated based on existing insights.
(2) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p14.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Self-verification</span>.
Another form of reflection involves evaluating the effectiveness of the agent’s actions.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>, the agent aims to accomplish tasks in Minecraft.
During each execution round, the agent utilizes GPT-4 as a critic to assess whether the current action is sufficient to achieve the desired task.
If the task fails, the critic offers feedback by suggesting approaches for completing the task.
Replug <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="" class="ltx_ref">124</a>]</cite> employs a training scheme to further adapt the retrieval model to the target language model. Specifically, it utilizes a language model as a scoring function to assess the contribution of each document towards reducing the perplexity of the language model. The retrieval model parameters are updated by minimizing the KL divergence between the retrieval probabilities and the language model scores.
This approach effectively evaluates the relevance of the retrieved results and adjusts them based on feedback from the language model.
(3) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p14.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Self-correction</span>.
In this type of reflection, the agent can correct its behaviors by incorporating feedback from the environment.
In MemPrompt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib96" title="" class="ltx_ref">96</a>]</cite>, the model can adjust its understanding of the tasks based on user feedback for generating more accurate answers. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>]</cite>, the agent is designed to play Minecraft, and it takes actions based on predefined plans.
When the plan fails, the agent rethinks its plan and changes it to continue the exploration process.
(4) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p14.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Empathy</span>.
Memory reflection can also be leveraged to enhance the agent’s empathy capability.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite>, the agent is a chatbot, but it generates utterances by considering the human cognition process.
After each round of conversation, the agent evaluates the impact of his words on the listener and updates his beliefs about the listener’s states.

LLM+P <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite> transforms natural language descriptions into a formal Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). Then, results are computed using an external planner and transformed into natural language by the LLMs finally. Likewise, LLM-DP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> utilizes the LLM to convert observation, current world state, and target objectives into PDDL format.

MRKL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite> is a modular, neural-symbolic AI architecture, where LLMs process the input texts, routes them to each of the experts, and then pass them through the LLMs’ outputs. CO-LLM  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite> consider that LLMs are good at generating high-level plans, but not good at low-level controlling. They use a heuristically designed low-level planner to robustly implement base actions according to high-level plans. With expert planners in the sub-task domains, it is possible for LLM to navigate the planning of complex tasks in specific domains.

In many studies, the agents make plans based on environmental feedback.
For example, ReAct <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>]</cite> extends the agent’s action space to a collection of actions and language space. Explicit reasoning and actions are performed sequentially, and when the feedback from an action does not have the correct answer, reasoning will be performed again until obtaining the correct answer.
Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> self-refines the agent generation scripts by acting on three types of feedback until it passes self-validation and is deposited in the skills library.
Ghost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite>, DEPS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>]</cite> can receive feedback from the environment, including information about the current state of the agent in the environment, and the information about the success or failure of each action performed. By integrating this feedback, the agents can update their understanding of the environment, improve their strategy and adapt their behaviors.
Based on Zero-Shot Planners <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>, Re-prompting <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib117" title="" class="ltx_ref">117</a>]</cite> uses the pre-condition errors information to detect whether the agent is capable of completing the current planning. It also uses the precondition information to re-prompt the LLM to complete the closed-loop control.
Inner Monologue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> appends three types of environmental feedback: successful execution of sub-tasks, passive scene description, and active scene description to instruction, thus enabling closed-loop planning for LLM-based agents.
Introspective Tips <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> allows LLM to introspect through the history of the environmental feedback.
LLM-Planner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="" class="ltx_ref">127</a>]</cite> introduces a grounded re-planning algorithm that dynamically updates plans generated by LLMs when encountering object mismatches and unattainable plans during task completion.
In Progprompt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="" class="ltx_ref">126</a>]</cite>, assertions are incorporated into the generated script to provide environment state feedback, allowing for error recovery in case the action’s preconditions are not satisfied.

Specifically, the LLM is utilized as a generator, feedback provider, and refiner. First, the generator is used to generate an initial output, then the feedback provider presents specific and actionable feedback for the output, and finally, the refiner is used to improve the output using the feedback. The reasoning power of LLM is improved by an iterative feedback loop between the generator and the critic. Reflexion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>]</cite> is a framework for enhancing agent through verbally feedback, which introduces memory mechanism. The actor first generates the action, then the evaluator generates the evaluation, and finally a summary of the past experience is generated by a self-reflective model. The summary will be stored in memory to further improving the generation of the actor through the past experience.
World model typically refers to an agent’s internal representation of the environment, which is utilized for internal simulation and abstraction of the environment.

RAP <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> involves utilizing LLMs both as the world model and as the agent. During the reasoning process, the agent constructs a reasoning tree, while the world model provides rewards as feedback. The agent performs MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) on the reasoning tree to obtain the optimal plan. Similarly, REX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite> introduces an accelerated MCTS approach where rewards feedback are furnished by either the environment or the LLM.

A fundamental goal of the action module is to complete a specific task in a logical manner.

The ability of LLM-based autonomous agents to conduct a natural language dialogue with humans is essential since human users usually need to obtain the agent status or complete collaborative tasks with agents.
Previous work has improved the dialogue interaction ability of agents in diverse domains.

LLM-based autonomous agents can be enhanced through the incorporation of external tools and the expansion of knowledge sources.
On the one hand, the agents can be equipped with the ability to access and employ a variety of APIs, databases, web applications, and other external resources during the training or inference stage.
For example, Toolformer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite> is trained to determine the appropriate APIs to call upon, the timing for these calls, and the optimal method of integrating the returned results into future token prediction.
ChemCrow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> designs a chemistry-oriented LLM-based agent, which incorporates seventeen expert-designed tools, to perform tasks including organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design.
ViperGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> presents a code-generation framework, which assembles vision-and-language models into subroutines that is able to return results for any given query.
HuggingGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> employs LLMs to connect diverse AI models in machine learning communities (<em id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p10.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, Hugging Face) to resolve AI tasks. In specific, HuggingGPT proposes a meta-learning approach to train LLMs to generate code snippets, and then use these snippets to call upon the desired AI models from the external community hub.
One the other hand, the scope and quality of knowledge that agents directly access can be broadened with the help of external knowledge sources.
In previous work, the external knowledge sources contains databases, knowledge graphs, web pages, and so on.
For example, Gorilla <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="" class="ltx_ref">111</a>]</cite> is able to effectively provide appropriate API calls, since it is trained on three extra machine learning hub datasets: Torch Hub, TensorFlow Hub, and HuggingFace.
WebGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>]</cite> proposes an extension that can incorporate the relevant results retrieved from websites into prompts when using ChatGPT, thus leading to more accurate and timely conversations.
ChatDB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> is an AI database assistant that utilizes SQL statements generated by the LLM controller to operate the external database accurately.
GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> uses LLMs to generate explainable results of text mining tasks, which employs a novel text mining pipeline that integrates LLMs, knowledge extraction and topic modeling modules.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p11.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p11.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Action Space</span>: The action space of LLM-based agents refers to the set of possible actions that can be performed by the agent. This stems from two main sources: external tools that expand the action capabilities, and the agent’s own knowledge and skills such as language generation and memory-based decision making. Specifically, external tools include search engines, knowledge bases, computing tools, other language models, and visual models. By interfacing with these tools, agents can execute diverse realistic actions like information retrieval, data querying, mathematical computations, sophisticated language production, and image analysis. The agent’s self-acquired knowledge based on the language model can empower the agent to plan, generate language, and make decisions, further expanding its action potential.</p>

Various external tools or knowledge sources provide much richer action capabilities for agents, including APIs, knowledge bases, visual models, language models, and so on.
(1) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p12.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">APIs</span>.
Leveraging external APIs to complement and expand action space is a popular paradigm in recent years.
For example,
HuggingGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> uses search engines, transforming queries into search request to fetch relevant code.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib105" title="" class="ltx_ref">105</a>, <a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite> propose to automatically generate queries to extract relevant content from external web pages when responding to user request.
TPTU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite> interfaces with both Python interpreters and LaTeX compilers to execute sophisticated computations such as square roots, factorials and matrix operations.
Another type of APIs is the ones that can be directly invoked by LLMs based on natural language or code inputs. For instance,
ToolFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite> is an LLM-based tool transformation system that can automatically convert a given tool into another one with different functionalities or formats based on natural language instructions.
API-Bank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite> is an LLM-based API recommendation agent that can automatically search and generate appropriate API calls for various programming languages and domains. API-Bank also provides an interactive interface for users to easily modify and execute the generated API calls.
Similarly, ToolBench <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> is an LLM-based tool generation system that can automatically design and implement various practical tools based on natural language requirements. The tools generated by ToolBench include calculators, unit converters, calendars, maps, charts, etc.
All these agents utilize external APIs as their external tools, and provide interactive interfaces for users to easily modify and execute the generated or transformed tools.
(2) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p12.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Knowledge Bases</span>.
Connecting to external knowledge bases can help the agents to obtain specific domain information for generating more realistic actions.
For example, ChatDB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite> employs SQL statements to query databases, facilitating actions by the agents in a logical manner.
ChemCrow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> presents an LLM-based chemical agent aimed at accomplishing tasks in the fields of organic synthesis, drug discovery, and material design, with the help of seventeen expert-designed tools.
MRKL Systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib71" title="" class="ltx_ref">71</a>]</cite>, OpenAGI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> incorporates various expert systems such as knowledge bases and planners, invoking them to access domain-specific information in a systematic manner.
(3) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p12.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Language Models</span>.
Language models can also act as tools to enrich the action spaces.
For example, MemoryBank <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib158" title="" class="ltx_ref">158</a>]</cite> employs two language models, one aims to encode input text while the other is responsible to match the arrived query statements to provide auxiliary textual retrieval.
ViperGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> firstly uses Codex, which is based on language model, to generate Python code from text descriptions, and then executes the code to complete the given tasks.
TPTU <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="" class="ltx_ref">118</a>]</cite> incorporates various LLMs to accomplish a wide range of language generation tasks such as generating code, producing lyrics, and more.
(4) <span id="S2.SS1.SSS4.p12.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Visual Models</span>. Integrating visual models with agents can broaden the action space into the multi-modal domain.
ViperGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> leverages models like GLIP to extract image features for visual content-related actions.
HuggingGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> proposes to use visual models for image processing and generation.</p>

An agent’s self-acquired knowledge also affords diverse behaviors, such as leveraging LLM’s generative powers for planning and language production, making decisions based on memories, etc. An agent’s self-acquired knowledge such as memories, experiences, and language capabilities enable diverse tool-free actions.
For instance, Generative Agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite> maintains comprehensive memory logs of all past dialogues. When taking actions, it retrieves relevant memory snippets as conditional inputs to guide the LLM in autoregressively generating logical and consistent language plans.
GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> constructs a memory base of experiences like discovered villages or collected resources. When acting, it queries the memory base for relevant entries, such as recalling a previous village direction to move towards that location again.
SayCan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> develops a reinforcement learning framework where the agent repeatedly adjusts actions like motions purely based on environment feedback for automated trial-and-error improvements, without any human demonstrations or interventions.
Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> leverages the LLM’s broad language generation capabilities to synthesize free-form textual solutions like Python code snippets or conversational responses tailored to current needs.
Similarly, LATM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> empowers LLMs to utilize Python code for crafting its own reusable tools, fostering a flexible approach to problem-solving.
CAMEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite> records all historical experiences in a memory stream. The LLM then draws from relevant memories to autoregressively generate high-level textual plans outlining intended future courses of action.
ChatDev <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite> equips LLM agents with a dialogue history memory to determine appropriate conversational responses and actions based on context.
In summary, an agent’s internal knowledge enables a diverse repertoire of tool-free actions via approaches like memory recollection, feedback adjustment, and open-ended language generation.</p>

Actions can directly alter environment states, such as moving agent positions, collecting items, constructing buildings, etc.
For instance, GITM<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> and Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> change environment states by executing action sequences that complete tasks.

Actions taken by agent can also change the agent itself, including updating memories, forming new plans, acquiring novel knowledge, and more.
For example, in Generative Agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>, memory streams are updated after performing actions within the system.

For most LLM-based autonomous agents, actions are usually taken in a sequential manner, that is, the former action can trigger the next new action.
For example, Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> seeks to construct buildings after collecting the environmental resources in Minecraft scenario.
Generative Agents<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite> firstly decomposes the plans into sub-goals, and then conducts a series of related actions to complete each sub-goal.</p>

The language, imagery and other modalities from actions directly influence user perceptions and experiences.
For example, CAMEL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>]</cite> generates utterances that are coherent, informative, and engaging for conversational agents.
ViperGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib128" title="" class="ltx_ref">128</a>]</cite> produces visuals that are realistic, diverse, and relevant for image generation tasks. HuggingGPT <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib123" title="" class="ltx_ref">123</a>]</cite> can generate visual outputs, such as images, to extend human perceptions into the realm of visual experiences. Moreover, HuggingGPT can also generate multimodal outputs, such as code, music, and video, to enrich human interactions with different media forms.

Summary of the construction strategies of representative agents (more agents can be seen on https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey).
For the profile module, we focus on the profile generation strategies, and use ①, ② and ③ to represent the handcrafting method, LLM-generation method, and dataset alignment method, respectively.
For the memory module, we focus on the implementation strategies for memory operation and memory structure.
For memory operation, we use ① and ② to indicate that the model only has read/write operations and has read/write/reflection operations, respectively.
For memory structure, we use ① and ② to represent unified and hybrid memories, respectively.
For the planning module, we use ① and ② to represent planning w/o feedback and w/ feedback, respectively.
For the action module, we use ① and ② to represent that the model does not use tools and use tools, respectively.
Beyond the above agent design strategies, we also present the learning strategies (LS) of these agents. In specific, we use ①, ② and ③ to represent learning from examples, human feedback and environment feedback, respectively.</figcaption>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Learning stands as an essential mechanism for humans to attain both knowledge and skills, fostering the augmentation of their capabilities—a significance extended profoundly to the realm of LLM-based agents. Through the process of learning, these agents are imbued with the capacity to demonstrate heightened mastery in adhering to instructions, deftly navigating intricate tasks, and seamlessly adapting to unprecedented and diverse environments. This transformative process empowers these agents to evolve beyond their initial programming, enabling them to perform tasks with greater finesse and flexibility. In this chapter, we will delve into various learning strategies employed by LLM-based agents and explore their far-reaching impacts.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Learning from Example</span>: Learning from examples is a foundational process that underpins human and AI learning. In the realm of LLM-based agents, this principle is embodied in fine-tuning, where these agents refine their skills through exposure to real-world data.</p>

In the pursuit of harmony with human values, integrating human-generated feedback data becomes a cornerstone of fine-tuning LLMs. This practice is particularly crucial in shaping intelligent agents designed to complement or even replace human involvement in specific tasks. The CoH approach, proposed by Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib91" title="" class="ltx_ref">91</a>]</cite>, involves a multi-step process where the LLM generates responses, assessed by human reviewers to differentiate favorable from unfavorable outcomes. This amalgamation of responses and evaluations contributes to the fine-tuning process, arming the LLM with a comprehensive understanding of errors and the ability to rectify them while staying aligned with human preferences. Despite the simplicity and directness of this approach, it is encumbered by substantial annotation costs and time, posing challenges in rapid adaptation to disparate scenarios. MIND2WEB <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> fine-tunes using human-annotated real-world website task data from diverse domains, resulting in a general agent that performs effectively across actual websites.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><math id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\bullet" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∙</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1.1">∙</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1c">\bullet</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS2.p4.1.m1.1d">∙</annotation></semantics></math> <span id="S2.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Learning from LLMs’ Annotations</span>.
During pre-training, LLMs acquire a wealth of world knowledge from extensive training data. After fine-tuning and alignment with humans, they exhibit capabilities akin to human judgment, as exemplified by models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Hence, we can utilize LLMs for annotation tasks, which can significantly reduce costs compared to human annotation, offering the potential for extensive data acquisition.
Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib92" title="" class="ltx_ref">92</a>]</cite> proposed a stable alignment approach for fine-tuning LLMs based on social interaction. They devised a sandbox environment containing multiple agents, each responding to a probing question. These responses are then evaluated and scored by nearby agents and ChatGPT. Subsequently, the responding agent refines their answer based on these evaluations, which is then re-scored by ChatGPT. This iterative process yields a substantial corpus of interactive data, which is subsequently employed for fine-tuning LLMs using contrastive supervised learning. In Refiner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="" class="ltx_ref">112</a>]</cite>, the generator is asked to generate intermediate steps and a critic model is introduced to generate structured feedback. Then, the feedback records is used to fine-tune the generator model to improve inference ability.
In ToolFormer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib119" title="" class="ltx_ref">119</a>]</cite>, a pre-training corpus is marked with potential API calls using LLMs. Then, LLMs are fine-tuned on this annotated data to learn how and when to use APIs, and integrate API results into their text generation. Similarly, ToolBench <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="" class="ltx_ref">115</a>]</cite> is also a dataset entirely generated using ChatGPT, designed for fine-tuning and enhancing LLMs’ proficiency in utilizing tools. ToolBench comprises an extensive collection of API descriptions, accompanied by directives that outline tasks to be accomplished using specific APIs, along with the corresponding sequences of actions to fulfill these directives. The fine-tuning process using ToolBench results in a model termed ToolLLaMA, which demonstrates performance comparable to ChatGPT. Notably, ToolLLaMA exhibits robust generalization capabilities even when confronted with previously unseen APIs.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Learning from Environment Feedback</span>:
In many cases, intelligent agents need to proactively explore their surroundings and interact with the environment. Therefore, they require the ability to adapt to the environment and enhance their capabilities from environmental feedback. In the field of reinforcement learning, agents learn by continuously exploring the environment and adapting based on environmental feedback <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib68" title="" class="ltx_ref">68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib82" title="" class="ltx_ref">82</a>, <a href="#bib.bib98" title="" class="ltx_ref">98</a>, <a href="#bib.bib152" title="" class="ltx_ref">152</a>]</cite>. This principle also holds for intelligent agents based on LLMs. Voyager <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite> follows an iterative prompting method, where agents perform actions, gather environment feedback, and continuously iterate until newly acquired skills are validated and added to the skill repository through self-verification. Similarly, LMA3 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> autonomously sets goals and executes actions in interactive environments, with LLM scoring its performance as a reward function. By iterating this process, LMA3 independently learns a wide range of skills. Meanwhile, GITM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite> and Inner Monologue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite> integrate environmental feedback into the closed-loop process of planning based on large-scale language models. Furthermore, creating an environment that closely mirrors reality also contributes significantly to enhancing the agent’s performance. WebShop <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>]</cite> has developed a simulated e-commerce environment where the agent can engage in activities such as searching and making purchases, receiving corresponding rewards and feedback in return. In  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib145" title="" class="ltx_ref">145</a>]</cite>, an embodiment simulator is utilized to enable agents to interact within a simulated real-world environment, facilitating physical engagements that lead to the acquisition of embodied experiences. Subsequently, these experiences are employed to fine-tune the model, thereby enhancing its performance in downstream tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive to learning from annotations, learning from environmental feedback distinctly encapsulates the autonomy and independence characteristic of LLM-based agents. This divergence exemplifies a profound interplay between environmental responsiveness and autonomous learning, fostering a nuanced understanding of agent behavior and adaptation.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Learning from Interactive Human Feedback</span>:
Interactive human feedback provides the agent with the opportunities to adapt, evolve, and refine their behaviors under human guidance in a dynamic manner.
Compared to one-shot feedback, interactive feedback is more aligned with real-world scenarios.
As the agents are learned in a dynamic process, they do more than just process static data - they participate in a continual refinement of their understanding, adaptation, and alignment with humans.
For example,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite> incorporates a communication module that enables collaborative task completion via chat-based interaction and feedback from humans.
As highlighted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib122" title="" class="ltx_ref">122</a>]</cite>, interactive feedback fosters key aspects such as reliability, transparency, immediacy, task characteristics, and the evolution of trust over time when learning the agents.</p>

In contrast, agent-based simulation enables researchers to construct hypothetical scenarios under specific rules to simulate a range of social phenomena, e.g., the propagation of harmful information. The researcher engages in both observes and intervenes within the system at both macro and micro levels, which enables them to study counterfactual events <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib81" title="" class="ltx_ref">81</a>, <a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">76</a>, <a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>, <a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib140" title="" class="ltx_ref">140</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section introduces the evaluation methods for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-based autonomous agents.
Similar to LLM itself, the evaluation of AI agent is not an easy problem.
Here, we present two commonly used evaluation strategies for assessing AI agents: subjective and objective evaluation. (Refer to the right part of Figure <a href="#S2.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Learning Strategy ‣ 2 LLM-based Autonomous Agent Construction ‣ A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> for an overview.)</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">4.1 </span>Subjective Evaluation</h3>

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">LLM-based agents have a wide range of applications. However, in many scenarios, there lacks general metrics to evaluate the performance of agents. Some potential properties, like agent’s intelligence and user-friendliness, cannot be measured by quantitative metrics as well. Therefore, subjective evaluation is indispensable for current research.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Subjective evaluation refers to the testing of the capabilities of LLM-based agents by humans through various means such as interaction, scoring, and so on. In this case, the participating testers are often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>, <a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite>; while some researchers believe that crowdsourced personnel are unstable due to individual differences and use expert annotations to conduct the tests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>]</cite>. In the following, we present two commonly leveraged strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Human Annotation</span>: In some studies, the human evaluators directly rank or score the generated results of the LLM-based agents based on some specific perspectives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib163" title="" class="ltx_ref">163</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>]</cite>; Another evaluation type is user-centred, which asks human evaluators to response whether the LLM-based agents system is helpful to them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite> and whether it is user-friendly  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>, and so on. In specific, one possible evaluation can be whether a social simulation system can effectively contribute to the enhancement of rule design for online communities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Turing Test</span>: In this method, human evaluators are always asked to distinguish between agent and human behaviours. In Generative Agents <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>, the first cohort of human evaluators are asked to assess agents’ key competencies in five areas by interviewing. After two days of play time, another cohort of human evaluators will be asked to differentiate between agents and human responses under the same conditions. In the Free-form Partisan Text experiment<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, human evaluators are asked to guess whether responses are from human or LLM-based agent.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Because the LLM-based agent system ultimately serves humans, manual evaluation plays an irreplaceable role at this stage, but it also suffers from expensive costs, low efficiency, and population bias. With advances in LLM, it can somewhat play the role of a human for assessment tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In some of the current studies, additional LLM-agents can be employed as subjective evaluators of the results. In ChemCrow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, EvaluatorGPT evaluates the outcomes of the experiment by assigning grades that consider both the successful completion of tasks and the accuracy of the underlying thought processes. ChatEval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> assembles a panel of multiple agent referees based on LLMs to evaluate the results generated by models through debates. We believe that with the progress of LLM, the results of model evaluation will be more credible and the application will be more extensive.</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Objective evaluation offers several benefits over human evaluations. Quantitative metrics enable clear comparisons between different methods and tracking of progress over time. Large-scale automated testing is feasible, allowing evaluation on thousands of tasks rather than a handful <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Results are also more objective and reproducible. However, human evaluations can assess complementary qualities like naturalness, nuance, and social intelligence that are difficult to quantify objectively. The two approaches can therefore be used in conjunction.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Objective evaluation refers to assessing the capabilities of LLM-based autonomous agents using quantitative metrics that can be computed, compared and tracked over time. In contrast to subjective or human evaluations, objective metrics aim to provide concrete, measurable insights into agent performance. In this section, we review and synthesize objective evaluation approaches from the perspectives of metrics, strategies and benchmarks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Metrics</span>:
In order to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of the agents, designing proper metrics is significant, which may influence the evaluation accuracy and comprehensiveness.
Ideal evaluation metrics should precisely reflect the quality of the agents, and align with the human feelings when using them in real-world scenarios.
In existing work, we can see the following representative evaluation metrics.
(1) <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Task success metrics:</span> These metrics measure how well an agent can complete tasks and achieve goals. Common metrics include success rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>, <a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>, <a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite>, reward/score <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>, <a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>, <a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite>, coverage <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>]</cite>, and accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>. Higher values indicate greater task completion ability.
(2) <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Human similarity metrics:</span> These metrics quantify the degree to which agent behavior closely resembles that of humans.
Typical examples include trajectory/location accuracy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>, dialogue similarities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and mimicry of human responses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Higher similarity suggests more human-like reasoning.
(3) <span id="S4.SS2.p3.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Efficiency metrics:</span>
In contrast to the aforementioned metrics used to evaluate agent effectiveness, these metrics assess agent efficiency from various perspectives. Typical metrics include planning length <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>]</cite>, development cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>]</cite>, inference speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>]</cite>, and number of clarification dialogues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S4.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S4.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Strategies</span>: Based on the methods employed for evaluation, we can identify several common strategies:
(1) <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Environmental simulation:</span>
In this method, the agents are assessed in immersive 3D environments such as games and interactive fiction using metrics for task success and human similarity, which incorporate factors like trajectories, language usage, and completed objectives <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib156" title="" class="ltx_ref">156</a>, <a href="#bib.bib161" title="" class="ltx_ref">161</a>, <a href="#bib.bib151" title="" class="ltx_ref">151</a>, <a href="#bib.bib133" title="" class="ltx_ref">133</a>, <a href="#bib.bib99" title="" class="ltx_ref">99</a>, <a href="#bib.bib137" title="" class="ltx_ref">137</a>, <a href="#bib.bib85" title="" class="ltx_ref">85</a>, <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>, <a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite>.
This showcases the agents’ practical abilities in real-world scenarios.
(2) <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Isolated reasoning:</span>
In this method, the researchers concentrate on fundamental cognitive abilities by employing limited tasks such as accuracy, passage completion rate, and ablation measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="" class="ltx_ref">113</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib125" title="" class="ltx_ref">125</a>, <a href="#bib.bib90" title="" class="ltx_ref">90</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>, <a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite>.
This approach simplifies the analysis of individual skills.
(3) <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Social evaluation:</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib110" title="" class="ltx_ref">110</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib89" title="" class="ltx_ref">89</a>, <a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>]</cite> directly probe social intelligence using human studies and mimicry metrics. This assesses higher-order social cognition.
(4) <span id="S4.SS2.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Multi-task:</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib114" title="" class="ltx_ref">114</a>, <a href="#bib.bib93" title="" class="ltx_ref">93</a>, <a href="#bib.bib94" title="" class="ltx_ref">94</a>, <a href="#bib.bib149" title="" class="ltx_ref">149</a>, <a href="#bib.bib155" title="" class="ltx_ref">155</a>]</cite> use suites of diverse tasks from different domains with zero/few-shot evaluation.

The evaluation of the agents play significant roles in this domain. However, both subjective and objective evaluation have their own strengths and weakness. Maybe, in practice, they should be combined together to comprehensively evaluate the agents.

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With the vigorous development of large language models, numerous comprehensive surveys have emerged, providing detailed insights into various aspects.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">157</a>]</cite> extensively introduces the background, main findings, and mainstream technologies of LLMs, encompassing a vast array of existing works. On the other hand,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib148" title="" class="ltx_ref">148</a>]</cite> primarily focus on the applications of LLMs in various downstream tasks and the challenges associated with their deployment. Aligning LLMs with human intelligence is an active area of research to address concerns such as biases and illusions.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib136" title="" class="ltx_ref">136</a>]</cite> have compiled existing techniques for human alignment, including data collection and model training methodologies. Reasoning is a crucial aspect of intelligence, influencing decision-making, problem-solving, and other cognitive abilities.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> presents the current state of research on LLMs’ reasoning abilities, exploring approaches to improve and evaluate their reasoning skills.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib100" title="" class="ltx_ref">100</a>]</cite> propose that language models can be enhanced with reasoning capabilities and the ability to utilize tools, termed Augmented Language Models (ALMs). They conduct a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in ALMs. As the utilization of large-scale models becomes more prevalent, evaluating their performance is increasingly critical.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> shed light on evaluating LLMs, addressing what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to assess their performance in downstream tasks and societal impact.
 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> also discusses the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in various downstream tasks.
The aforementioned research encompasses various aspects of large models, including training, application, and evaluation. However, prior to this paper, no work has specifically focused on the rapidly emerging and highly promising field of LLM-based Agents. In this study, we have compiled 100 relevant works on LLM-based Agents, covering their construction, applications, and evaluation processes.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While previous work for LLM-based autonomous AI agent has shown many promising directions, this field is still at its initial stage, and many challenges exist on its development road.
In the follow, we present several important challenges.</p>
</div>
<section id="S6.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.1 </span>Role-playing Capability</h3>

<div id="S6.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Different from traditional LLMs, AI agent usually has to play as specific roles (<em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, program coder, researcher and chemist) for accomplishing different tasks.
Thus, the capability of the agent for role-playing is very important. While for many common roles (<em id="S6.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">e.g.</em>, movie reviewers), LLMs can well simulate them, there are still many roles and aspects that LLMs can be hard to capture.
To begin with, LLMs are usually trained based on web-corpus, thus for the roles which are seldom discussed on the web or the newly emerging roles, LLMs may not simulate them well.
In addition, previous research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> has shown that existing LLMs may not well model the human cognitive psychology characters, leading to the lack of self-awareness in conversation scenarios.
Potential solution to these problems may fine-tuning LLMs or carefully designing the agent prompts/architectures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">77</a>]</cite>.
For example, one can firstly collect real-human data for uncommon roles or psychology characters, and then leverage it to fine-tune LLMs.
However, how to ensure that fine-tuned model still perform well for the common roles may pose further challenges.
Beyond fine-tuning, one can also design tailored agent prompts/architectures to enhance the capability of LLM on role-playing.
However, finding the optimal prompts/architectures is not easy, since their designing spaces are too large.</p>

<section id="S6.SS2" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.2 </span>Generalized Human Alignment</h3>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Human alignment has been discussed a lot for traditional LLMs.
In the field of autonomous AI agent, especially when the agents are leveraged for simulation, we believe this concept should be discussed more in depth.
In order to better serve human-beings, traditional LLMs are usually fine-tuned to be aligned with correct human values, for example, the agent should not plan to make a bomb for avenging society.
However, when the agents are leveraged for real-world simulation, an ideal simulator should be able to honestly depict diverse human traits, including the ones with incorrect values.
Actually, simulating the human negative aspects can be even more important, since an important goal of simulation is to discover and solve problems, and without negative aspects means no problem to be solved.
For example, to simulate the real-world society, we may have to allow the agent to plan for making a bomb, and observe how it will act to implement the plan as well as the influence of its behaviors.
Based on these observations, people can make better actions to stop similar behaviors in real-world society.
Inspired by the above case, maybe an important problem for agent-based simulation is how to conduct generalized human alignment, that is, for different purposes and applications, the agent should be able to align with diverse human values.
However, existing powerful LLMs including ChatGPT and GPT-4 are mostly aligned with unified human values.
Thus, an interesting direction is how to “realign” these models by designing proper prompting strategies.</p>

<section id="S6.SS3" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.3 </span>Prompt Robustness</h3>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To ensure rational behavior in agents, designers often incorporate additional modules, such as memory and planning modules, into LLMs. However, the inclusion of these modules necessitates the development of more prompts in order to facilitate consistent operation and effective communication. Previous research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib162" title="" class="ltx_ref">162</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite> has highlighted the lack of robustness in prompts for LLMs, as even minor alterations can yield substantially different outcomes. This issue becomes more pronounced when constructing autonomous agents, as they encompass not a single prompt but a prompt framework that considers all modules, wherein the prompt for one module has the potential to influence others.
Moreover, the prompt frameworks can vary significantly across different LLMs. Developing a unified and robust prompt framework that can be applied to various LLMs is an important yet unresolved issue.
There are two potential solutions to the aforementioned problems: (1) manually crafting the essential prompt elements through trial and error, or (2) automatically generating prompts using GPT.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.4 </span>Hallucination</h3>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hallucination poses a fundamental challenge for LLMs, wherein the model erroneously outputs false information confidently. This issue is also prevalent in autonomous agents. For instance, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>, it was observed that when confronted with simplistic instructions during code generation tasks, the agent may exhibit hallucinatory behavior. Hallucination can lead to serious consequences such as incorrect or misleading code, security risks, and ethical issues <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">67</a>]</cite>. To address this problem, one possible approach is to incorporate human correction feedback within the loop of human-agent interaction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>.
More discussions on the hallucination problem can be seen in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib157" title="" class="ltx_ref">157</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An important application of autonomous AI Agent is to simulate different real-world human behaviors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="" class="ltx_ref">109</a>]</cite>.
The study of human simulation has a long history, and the recent surge in interest can be attributed to the remarkable advancements made by LLMs, which have demonstrated significant capabilities in simulating human behavior.
However, it is important to recognize that the power of LLMs may not always be advantageous. Specifically, an ideal simulation should accurately replicate human knowledge. In this regard, LLMs can exhibit excessive power, as they are trained on an extensive corpus of web knowledge that surpasses the scope of ordinary individuals.
The immense capabilities of LLMs can significantly impact the effectiveness of simulations. For instance, when attempting to simulate user selection behaviors for various movies, it is crucial to ensure that LLMs assume a position of having no prior knowledge of these movies. However, there is a possibility that LLMs have already acquired information about these movies. Without implementing appropriate strategies, LLMs may make decisions based on their extensive knowledge, even though real-world users would not have access to the contents of these movies beforehand.
Based on the above example, we may conclude that for building believable agent simulation environment, an important problem is how to constrain the utilization of user-unknown knowledge of LLM.</p>

<div id="S6.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S6.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Because of its auto-regressive architecture, LLMs typically have slow inference speeds.
However, the agent may need to query LLMs for each action multiple times, such as extracting information from the memory module, make plans before taking actions and so on.
Consequently, the efficiency of agent actions is greatly affected by the speed of LLM inference.
Deploying multiple agents with the same API key can further significantly increase the time cost.</p>
