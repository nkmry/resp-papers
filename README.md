# responsive papers
[ar5iv](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/) is great to display articles from arXiv.org as responsive HTML5 web pages.  
However, it hasnâ€™t shown the latest papers because too many papers are going to be published continuously 
and ar5iv can't handle all of them immediately. Its process can be delayed a month.  
So, I process some new papers I want to read in the same way as ar5iv and host them here.  

You can read them from the following URLs:
